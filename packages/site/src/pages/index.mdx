# Next Generation React Stories

Showcase.js is a React story visualizer and test framework. Using Showcase, you can build a storybook-like environment for your React components and perform visual regression tests using your own CI.

## Why?

The front-end ecosystem is moving fast. Bleeding-edge bundlers and frameworks are coming out each week. We need new tools that can keep up with the pace of change. Showcase's long-term vision is to be bundler agnostic and to be able to work with any bundler and any browser automation tool.

- **Bundler agnostic** - Showcase should be able to work with any bundler. It should not be tied to a specific bundler.
- **Browser automation agnostic** - Showcase should be able to work with any browser automation tool. It should not be tied to a specific browser automation tool.
- **CI agnostic** - Showcase should be able to work with any CI. It should not be tied to a specific CI and can be run locally.
