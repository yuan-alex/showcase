# React Stories from the Future

  Showcase is pre-alpha software. Do not use it for your project.
</Callout>

Showcase is focused on:

- Story version control
- Developer experience & performance
- Bundler interoperability
- Visual snapshot testing

## How it works

The Showcase CLI finds all story files `(*.stories.tsx)` and creates a bundler target file that imports and exports all stories from your project. Vite will then bundle a pre-compiled client with the bundler target that is served to the browser.
