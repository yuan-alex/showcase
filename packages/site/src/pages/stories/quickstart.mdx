# Stories

By default, Showcase searches for stories in the format of `src/**/*.stories.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`. You can change this by setting the `stories` property in your `.showcase/config.mjs` file.

```tsx
export default {
  stories: 'src/**/*.stories.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
} 
```

## Creating Stories

Showcase uses [CSF](https://github.com/ComponentDriven/csf) (Component Story Format) to define stories. This is the same format used by Storybook and Ladle. However, not all features of CSF are supported.

### Basic Example

```tsx
import { Button } from './Button';

export default {
  title: 'Button',
  component: Button,
};

export const Primary = () => <Button>Primary</Button>;
```

Much of the syntax is the same as Storybook.
