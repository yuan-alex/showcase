# Decorators

Adding a decorator to a story will wrap the story in the decorator. In the example below, the story will be wrapped in a `ThemeProvider` component.

```tsx
import { Button, ThemeProvider } from "@primer/react";

export default {
  title: "Button",
  component: Button,
  decorators: [
    (Story) => (
      <ThemeProvider>
        <Story />
      </ThemeProvider>
    ),
  ],
};
```
