# Bundlers

We minimize the amount of configuration you need to do by piggybacking off your pre-existing bundler. In most cases, no extra configuration is needed. If a supported configuration file is detected in the root directory of your project, Showcase will add in the minimum changes needed for the rendering engine.

However, mistakes happen and sometimes you will want to correct the configruation.


## Vite 4

Use the `viteFinal` property in your `.showcase/config.mjs`:

```js
export default {
  bundler: {
    viteFinal: (config) => {
      let config = config;
      // do something with the config
      return config;
    }
  },
};
```

## Webpack 5

Webpack support is in the works. This doesn't mean that you can't make Showcase work with Vite. If your project uses Webpack with `babel-loader` or `ts-loader`, Showcase may work right out of box. If you're using a custom Babel plugin, you can customize Showcase's Babel configuration using the `viteFinal` property.

## Next.js 13

Next.js support is in the works. Next uses Webpack with SWC under the hood, so you can expect this feature to be stable around the same time as Webpack.

## Rollup

Rollup support is in the works. Vite uses Rollup under the hood.

## Parcel 2

Parcel support is in the works.
