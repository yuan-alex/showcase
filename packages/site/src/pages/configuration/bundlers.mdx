# Bundlers

Showcase has first class support for Vite. It's the default bundler for Showcase.

## Vite

By default, Showcase uses [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) to display bundle your components. To change the Vite configuration, use the `viteFinal` property in your `.showcase/config.mjs`:

```js
export default {
  bundler: {
    viteFinal: (config) => {
      let config = config;
      // do something with the config
      config.plugins.push(yourOwnPlugin());
      return config;
    }
  },
};
```

## Webpack

Webpack support is in the works. This doesn't mean that you can't make Showcase work. If your project uses Webpack with `babel-loader` or `ts-loader`, Showcase may work right out of box. If you're using a custom Babel plugin, you can customize Showcase's Babel configuration using the `viteFinal` property.

## Next.js

Next.js support is in the works. Next uses Webpack with SWC under the hood, so you can expect this feature to be stable around the same time as Webpack.
