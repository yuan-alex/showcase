# Decorators

Just like Storybook, all decorators will run in the order they are defined in the following order:

- Global
- Component
- Story

## Global Decorators

Global decorators are defined in the `.showcase/preview.js` file.

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@primer/react";

export const decorators = [
  (Story) => (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Story />
    </ThemeProvider>
  ),
];
```

## Component Decorators

```tsx
import { Button, ThemeProvider } from "@primer/react";
import { ComponentMeta } from "@showcasejs/react";

export default {
  title: "Button",
  component: Button,
  decorators: [
    (Story) => (
      <ThemeProvider>
        <Story />
      </ThemeProvider>
    ),
  ],
} as ComponentMeta<typeof Button>;
```

## Story Decorators

```tsx
export const Primary = () => <Button>Primary</Button>;

Primary.decorators = [
  (Story) => (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Story />
    </ThemeProvider>
  ),
];
```
