# Git Based Storage

Relying on Git's version control history and conflict system is the easiest way to get started with VRT. You can take story screenshots using your own CI and store them in your Git repo. Developers will merge in story screenshots in the same PR they merge in new code. This keeps story snapshots and code up-to-date at the same time.
